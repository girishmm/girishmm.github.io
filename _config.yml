  Hi there, I'm Girish, an Information Technology major. Iâ€™m interested in the fascinating area that lies at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. I am convinced that a better understanding of the brain will lead to designing models that are truly 'intelligent'.

  When I'm not at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. During my time at Uni
  I have become a very keen marathoner. In 2018 I participated in my first half-marathon and completed
  it in sub two hours. In the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes,
  playing at one of Manipal's basketball courts or down the football field.
