 Hi, my name is Girish, an Information Technology major from Manipal Institute of
 Technology. My research interests primarily lie in Neuroscience. I am currently
  looking for opportunities to work on a project in this area. The things that I currently have
  the most experience working with are:
  <mark>Javascript</mark>,
  <mark>Angular</mark>
  <mark>Java</mark>,
  <mark>Python</mark>,
  <mark>Android</mark>,
  <mark>Swift</mark>, and
  <mark>Matlab</mark>.

  A proud Tamizhan hailing from Madurai, I spend my leisure time cycling to
  new destinations or playing the violin.

  When I'm not at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. During my time at Uni
  I have become a very keen marathoner. In 2018 I participated in my first half-marathon and completed
  it in sub two hours. In the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes,
  playing at one of Manipal's basketball courts or down the football field.
