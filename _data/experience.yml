    Worked at the Spectrum Lab, under the guidance of [Dr. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/), 
    on Sparse Independent Component Analysis for source separation in Neural Signals. During my time 
    at the lab I implemented ICA algorithms on an EEG dataset to obtain the independent components 
    and detect artifacts. I also had the chance to participate in [BCL 2019](https://www.iisc.ac.in/events/bcl-2019-third-workshop-on-brain-computation-and-learning/)
    workshop which helped me consolidate my interests.

  job_title: Telemetry Engineer

    SolarMobil is a student team from Manipal Institute of Technology that aims to fabricate a solar
    electric vehicle with a focus on practicality and feasibility. I was part of the team that 
    successfully launched the SM-S1 and SM-S2 prototypes. My responsibilities included calibration of 
    sensors, wiring inside the vehicle, and data visualization and monitoring of data transmitted 
    from the sensors mounted on the solar powered car. To serve this purpose, a cloud based android 
    application for remote monitoring and a pyQT interface on the dashboard was developed. Data 
    sampled by the sensors is transmitted to Raspberry Pi through CAN protocol after application of 
    filters like Kalman and median filters to reduce noise. The car is equipped with internet 
    through GSM modules to store data in cloud. I integrated a reverse guidence system with Raspberry 
    Pi and camera. 
    
    SolarMobil is the first student led Indian team to fabricate a successful solar 
    powered prototype. The prototype was awarded the first position in ASME Student Contest and third 
    place at Inter-University Contest.
